## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
print('Hello, World!')
```

## Packages and Datasets
There are many built-in functions and data sets include in R, which is known as base R.

In addition to base R, additional packages can be downloaded, imported and used.

This markdown file will cover how to work with built-in data sets and imported packages.

The following chuck will open a window with a list of built-in data sets you can experiment with.

```{r}
data()
```

## Iris Dataset

For today's session we will begin by looking at a built-in data set, known as iris.

To see the data, simply run the command `iris` in a code chunk.
```{r}
iris
```
As shown, there are 5 columns and 150 rows.

When wrangling data, it is often best to start by getting a summary of the data.

To do so, run the next chunk.
```{r}
summary(iris)
```
R conveniently offers descriptive statistics for each numerical column.

For the `Species` column, a count of the categorical variables is returned.

From this, we can tell that the data represents 3 species of iris, with 50 examples of each.

### Selecting Data

To select a single row of data from the data set, use a square bracket`[rows, columns]` and specify 
the row number followed by a `,`.
```{r}
iris[1,]
```

To select a single column of data from the dataset, use the `$` symbol followed by
the name of the column of interest.
```{r}
iris$Petal.Length
```

Alternatively, you can use a square bracket and specify the column number after a `,`.
```{r}
iris[,3]
```

You can also combine these methods to specify rows and columns simultaneously. 
```{r}
iris[130:150, 1:3]
```

Selecting rows and columns by index (number) can be useful, but sometimes it more
convenient to use labels. Conditions can also be applied when sub-setting data.
```{r}
iris[iris$Species=="setosa", ]
```

In the above example, by leaving the space following the comma blank, it will
return all columns of data. 

You can specify columns to be returned as well. For example,
```{r}
iris[iris$Species=="setosa", c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width")]
```

If you need a list of column names run the following command:
```{r}
colnames(iris)
```

## Vector math on datasets
The Basic_Commands.Rmd tutorial covered vector operations. You can apply those
examples to columns or rows of a data set.

Let's also introduce the `cat` command here. `cat` is used to concatenate info together.

Here we will concat our output to ensure the meaning is clear.

```{r}
column_of_interest = "Sepal.Length"
col_mean = mean(iris[,column_of_interest])
cat("The mean of the columm", column_of_interest, "is: ", col_mean)
```
To test, your knowledge, try the following:
  1. Update the above code to get the mean of another column.
  2. Apply a different function than the mean.
  3. Can you get summary stats for multiple columns at once?

## Packages

Now that we have examined working with and subsetting data frames, let's import a 
package and work with a more complex example. 

Running this in a new project or on your own computer for the fist time you would need to run `install.packages("survival")`.  Thereafter you only need to turn on the package, as shown below.  
```{r}
library(survival)
```

### PBC Dataset

You will read in the pbc data set from the survival package. To find more information on the pbc data set you can use `?pbc` or use the help tab in the right hand side and search for pbc.  This gives more information on how the data was created and what is in each column.
```{r}
pbc
```
Let's get an idea of what is in the data.

We will start by getting the help documentation using the `?` function in R.
```{r}
?pbc
```
This will pull up the documentation in the help pane of R Studio.
The help describes what the data set is from and what variables are in it.

We can also run the `summary` command to get an idea of what the data looks like.
```{r}
summary(pbc)
```
We can see from the output that some of the columns contain NA's or missing data.
Missing data can cause some functions to not run or to return a NULL value, so
it's important to note when data is missing.

### Data Exploration
You can select a single columns with a `$`.
```{r}
pbc$copper
```
You can use the `$` annotation to get summary information as well. 
Note, if missing data is in the column, result will be NA unless `na.rm` is specified as `TRUE`. 
```{r}
mean(pbc$copper)
mean(pbc$copper, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Other useful summary stats: min, max, and range.
```{r}
min(pbc$copper, na.rm = TRUE)
max(pbc$copper, na.rm = TRUE)
range(pbc$copper, na.rm = TRUE)
```
Data columns also have types and you can access this information with `typeof`.
```{r}
typeof(pbc$copper)
typeof(pbc$ast)
```

This concludes your introduction to using packages and built-in data sets.
